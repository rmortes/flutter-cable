# Cable
A helper to get Ferry to the other side of your project.

## Why does this project exists?
Every time I used Ferry, I found myself either writting tons of boilerplate code or copypasting the
same FastOp widget between projects, and improving it in different places.

This library is intended for my use exclusively, hence why I'm not publishing it to pub.dev

If you want to use this library, you can import it like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cable:
    git: https://github.com/rmortes/flutter_cable.git
```
